Week 3: Chordify Training Course

Problem Statement: Exercise: Build a Task Manager with Form Validation, Data Fetching, and Dynamic Rendering

No of attempts: 1

Objective: In this exercise, you will build a Task Manager app using React that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The app will feature form validation to ensure tasks are entered properly, fetch mock data from an API when the app loads, and use dynamic rendering with lists and conditional rendering. Deliverables: A fully functional task manager app with the following features: Add tasks with validation (ensuring tasks are not empty). Toggle tasks as completed. Remove tasks. Fetch mock data using useEffect() and display it as part of the tasks list (optional). Display error messages when needed (for empty task input). Manage state using useState() for task list, input, and error handling. Render lists dynamically using .map() and keys. Bonus: Add a feature to filter tasks (e.g., show only active or completed tasks). Implement a local storage mechanism to persist tasks even when the page is refreshed. Add animations or transitions when tasks are added, removed, or toggled.
